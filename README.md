# hello-world

Welcome to the CLSR gallery.

We are dedicated to the development and promotion of digitally active works within the Ryerson Image Arts faculty.

For scheduling information please contact Terence Reeves or Don Snyder.


HOW TO: Get Started
Strictly speaking, it is not necessary that users need to install Git on their computers, but I recommend it so that we can take advantage of the P5 IDE.
https://git-scm.com/downloads

Users will be required to register a username with Github. If you are reading this, you are already familiar with Github and this process should be simple enough for you.

I will not explain the details of how to use Git.
Or I might.
But for now take some time, RTFM, and figure it out if you can.
